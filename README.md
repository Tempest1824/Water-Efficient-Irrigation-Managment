# Water-Efficient-Irrigation-Managment
The Water-Efficient Irrigation System monitors soil moisture using Arduino-based nodes. Moisture data is sent wirelessly to a central receiver, which controls a motor and two solenoid valves via relays. The system irrigates two lands only when moisture is low, reducing water waste, conserving energy, and supporting sustainable farming.
